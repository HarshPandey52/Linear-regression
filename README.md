Machine Learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn from data and make decisions without being explicitly programmed for specific tasks. It relies on algorithms and models that improve their performance over time through exposure to data. The core idea is to use data to train a model, which can then make predictions or decisions based on new data. This involves several key steps: collecting relevant data, preprocessing it to ensure it is suitable for training, choosing an appropriate algorithm, training the model using the data, evaluating its performance, tuning it for better accuracy, and finally, using it to make predictions.
**Linear Regression** is a fundamental statistical technique in machine learning used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. The objective is to find the best-fitting straight line that represents this relationship. 
In this project I am using linear regression using gradient decent to obtain the salary of a person based on the working experience he has.
