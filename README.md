Machine Learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn from data and make decisions without being explicitly programmed for specific tasks. It relies on algorithms and models that improve their performance over time through exposure to data. The core idea is to use data to train a model, which can then make predictions or decisions based on new data. This involves several key steps: collecting relevant data, preprocessing it to ensure it is suitable for training, choosing an appropriate algorithm, training the model using the data, evaluating its performance, tuning it for better accuracy, and finally, using it to make predictions.
**Linear Regression** is a fundamental statistical technique in machine learning used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. The objective is to find the best-fitting straight line that represents this relationship. This line is expressed with the equation:

\[ y = b0 + b1 \cdot x1 + b2 \cdot x2 + \ldots + bn \cdot xn \]

In this equation, \( y \) is the predicted value, \( x1, x2, \ldots, xn \) are the input features, \( b0 \) is the intercept (the value of \( y \) when all \( x \) values are zero), and \( b1, b2, \ldots, bn \) are the coefficients that indicate how much each feature contributes to the prediction.

The goal of linear regression is to find the coefficients \( b \) that minimize the difference between the predicted values and the actual values. This difference is measured using the Mean Squared Error (MSE), which calculates the average squared difference between predicted and actual values:

\[ MSE = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} (y_{actual,i} - y_{predicted,i})^2 \]

where \( m \) is the number of data points. Linear regression is widely used because of its simplicity and effectiveness in predicting outcomes and identifying relationships between variables.
